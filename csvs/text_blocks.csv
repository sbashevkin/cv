intro,"I have worked in many rivers and aquatic systems in California, and continue to strive to find ways to apply research to conservation management. I am particularly interested in using a confluence of disciplines such as genomics, hydrology, ecology, and geomorphology to better understand current and future impacts to our freshwater ecosystems.

I am a strong advocate for open science, and education; and giving voices, training, and space for folks who support and foster a supportive community with diverse questions and views."
